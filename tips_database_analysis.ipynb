    "What could be interesting about this dataset?\n",
    "- Do people tip better on weekends? More likely to be out for the evening, possibly more likely to have a drink and therefore more likely to be generous with a tip?\n",
    "- Do people tip more if they are part of a larger group? More people to chip oin? Social pressure?\n",
    "- On the other hand, are people likely to tip less if they are on theor own?\n",
    "- Is there a sex difference in tipping? Why would there be? \n",
    "- Similarly, are men or women more likely to pay? Is there a difference in genders paying depending on group size? Cliche that men pay for dates if we look at tables of 2? Would the tips be higher in such cases?\n",
    "- How is the dataset gendered if there are several people at each table? Presumably the person that pays for the table is the gender recorded.\n",
    "- Do tips on average make up 10-15% of the bill or do they just round up to the nearest fiver/euro?\n",
    "- Does tip percentage of the bill grow as the bill does?\n",
    "- Are smokers more likely to tip? Why would they be/not? \n",
    "- Are smaller groups more likely to sit in smoking sections? Consideration for the whole group.\n",
    "- Is there a difference in tips on weekdays versus the weekend? On weekdays would people be more likely to just be grabbing a work lunch? Similarly, are the overall bills lower? - Doesn;t have all days of the week, just Thurs-Sun. \n",
    "- Which days are busiest? Does this affect the tips? Perhaps the service isn;t as great if the place is super busy?\n",
    "- Is it more likely there are larger groups on weekends as would be assumed?\n",

    "Article from 1984 seeing tipping is related to group size (larger groups tipped less), gender (men tipped more than women), and bill size (larger the per person bill, the lower the tip %). Of course, this is an old article. Would it even still be relevant?\n",

    "Knowledge gaps in this database that could affect tipping:\n",
    "- Food quality\n",
    "- Customer service\n",
    "- Restaurant atmosphere\n",
    "- Payment methods (cash v credit)\n",
